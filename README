What is it?
===========

This provides basic helper functions for C. It may include the following
categories of functions:

a) Portable versions of standard C functions, that can be used as drop-in
   replacements, with exactly the same semantics, excluding anti-features.

   You can alias these to standard C function names (with preprocessor macros,
   or even on the linker level).

b) Portable versions of standard C functions, with slightly different semantics,
   that can be used as drop-in replacements with some care. The semantics can
   be different to reduce annoying bugs, reduce dependencies and footprint, or
   because the standard functions are misdesigned.

   Depending on the details, you may alias them to standard function names, but
   with caveats you have to be aware of.

c) Like a) or b), but portability wrappers for crap OSes like Windows, Android,
   macOS, iOS, glibc-based Linux, etc.

d) Other helper functions.

Instead of standard C functions, they may be part of other standards, such as
POSIX.

Currently, only category b) wrappers for (v)snprintf and category a) wrappers
for strtod are provided.

Uses
====

- If you use C (or C++) in a library, and functions affected by locale, like
  snprintf, strtod/strtol, and others, but don't want your library to fucking
  explode if the library user sets the process locale.
- Low footprint in bare metal environments or for small static executables
  (however, the focus is on correctness, not small code size).

How to use
==========

I don't know, ask your mom? Currently, there are only test programs.

Conventions and rules
=====================

- Prefix all identifiers with lin_ or LIN_. (Exception: special include files
  that override standard C functions with category a) portable replacements,
  or macro-only identifiers in include files that specifically make non-prefixed
  identifiers visible.)
- Do not use any global mutable state.
- Do not override standard functions unless the user explicitly asks for it
  (i.e. don't be gnulib).
- Do not assume or hardcode implementation details of specific systems. One
  exception is when a known system requires workarounds for known standard
  violations. Code should work on arbitrary standard compliant systems.
- It's not a dumping ground for general utility functions (i.e. don't be glib).
- Try to reduce general entanglement within the library.
- No dependencies on broken libc mechanisms or types (such as locales, off_t).
- Avoid using: errno, stdio, malloc

Name
====

First I wanted to name it libsanity, because it was supposed to free programmers
from insane bullshit like global locales, and other extremely harmful things the
utterly incompetent C standard committees refuses to fix. But then I realized
this library will go down the drain over the years (if it ever gets to live),
and also people will disagree with what is considered sane.
